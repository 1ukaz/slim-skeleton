* Add your Facebook `{app_id}`, `{app_secret}` and `{app_token}` to `app/Config/settings.php` file.

## Run it!

* Execute `php -S 127.0.0.1:8100 -t public public/index.php` to run PHP Built in Server within app dir.

* Go ahead with Browser, Postman or equivalent and hit: `http://127.0.0.1:8100/profile/facebook/{profile-id}`

* That's it! Now go and hire the poor devil!
